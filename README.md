# Website Template Description

This HTML and CSS template is designed for a modern and stylish website layout. It consists of several sections:

## Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar (`<nav>`) is split into two parts:
  - Part 1 contains two black circles (`<div class="circle">`) as decorative elements.
  - Part 2 contains navigation links and additional information, such as language, country, profile, wishlist count, and search.

## Main Content
- The main content area (`<main>`) contains:
  - A navigation section (`<div id="nav">`) with links to different sections of the website.
  - A content section (`<div id="content">`) consisting of text and image content.
    - The text content is horizontally scrollable (`<div id="text-content">`) and contains headings (`<h1>`) for different items.
    - The image content is also horizontally scrollable (`<div id="image-content">`) and displays images using `<img>` tags.

## CSS Styling
- The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for various elements:
  - Navigation bar layout and styling, including circles and text alignment.
  - Styling for navigation links and additional information.
  - Text and image content layout, including scrollable behavior and snap points.
  - Custom scrollbar styling for the scrollable sections.

## Additional Notes
- The template uses flexbox and scroll behavior to create a modern and interactive user interface.
- It employs responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility with different screen sizes and devices.
